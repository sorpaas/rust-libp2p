//! The libp2p implemention of [Discovery V5](https://github.com/ethereum/devp2p/blob/master/discv5/discv5.md).
//!
//! # Overview
//!
//! Discovery v5 is a protocol designed for encrypted peer discovery and topic advertisement. Each peer/node
//! on the network is identified via it's ['ENR'] ([Ethereum Name
//! Record](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-778)), which is essentially a signed key-value store
//! containing the node's public key and optionally IP address and port.
//!
//! Discv5 employs a kademlia-like routing table to store and manage discovered peers and topics. The
//! protocol allows for external IP discovery in NAT environments through regular PING/PONG's with
//! discovered nodes. Nodes return the external IP address that they have received and a simple
//! majority is chosen as our external IP address. If an external IP address is updated, this is
//! produced as an event to notify the swarm (if one is used for this behaviour).
//!
//! This protocol is split into three main sections/layers:
//!
//!  * Transport - The transport for this protocol is currently fixed to UDP and is realised by the
//!  [`Discv5Service`] struct. It encodes/decodes [`Packet`]'s to and from the specified UDP
//!  socket.
//!  * Session - The protocol's communication is encrypted with `AES_GCM`. All node communication
//!  undergoes a handshake, which results in a [`Session`]. [`Session`]'s are established when
//!  needed and get dropped after a timeout. This section manages the creation and maintenance of
//!  sessions between nodes. It is realised by the [`SessionService`] struct.
//!  * Behaviour - This section contains the protocol-level logic. In particular it manages the
//!  routing table of known ENR's, topic registration/advertisement and performs various qeuries
//!  such as peer discovery. This section is realised by the [`Discv5`] struct.
//!
//!  *Note* -  Currently only `secp256k1` keys are supported.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! [`Discv5`] implements the [`NetworkBehaviour`] trait and can therefore be composed as a
//! behaviour on a [`Swarm`].  In order to start a [`Discv5`] service, an [`Enr`] is required. This
//! identifies the node, attributes various values to our node for broadcasting in the discovery
//! protocol. Although an IP can be specified in the ENR, the [`Discv5`] service requires a listen
//! address to allow for listening on multiple interfaces, more specifically, the `0.0.0.0`
//! address. The UDP port will be that of the ENR. If there is no port defined in the ENR, the
//! service creation will fail.
//!
//! A simple example of creating this service is as follows:
//!
//! ```rust
//! use libp2p_core::identity::Keypair;
//! use enr::{Enr,EnrBuilder};
//! use std::net::Ipv4Addr;
//! use libp2p_discv5::Discv5;
//!
//!   // generate a key for the node
//!   let keypair = Keypair::generate_secp256k1();
//!   // construct a local ENR
//!   let enr = EnrBuilder::new("v4")
//!        .ip("127.0.0.1".parse::<Ipv4Addr>().expect("valid address").into())
//!        .udp(9000)
//!        .build(&keypair)
//!        .unwrap();
//!
//!     // display the ENR's node id and base64 encoding
//!        println!("Node Id: {}", enr.node_id());
//!        println!("Base64 ENR: {}", enr.to_base64());
//!
//!    // construct the discv5 behaviour
//!    // the substream type is removed for demonstrative purposes
//!    let discv5: Discv5<()> = Discv5::new(enr, keypair, "0.0.0.0".parse::<Ipv4Addr>(). unwrap().into()).unwrap();
//! ```
//!
